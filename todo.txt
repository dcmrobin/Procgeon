need splash screen- "VELHO"

reimpliment brutes.

armor is way overpowered. the armorvalue needs to be reduced by a certain small amount with each hit from an enemy depending on the
damage that enemy does. then the currentarmorvalue needs to be reassigned after each bit of damage to the armor. armor value should
not be able to co below 0- if it would, the armor needs to show "broken" in its description.
