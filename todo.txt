need splash screen- "VELHO"

add an enemy that plays the happy music and attracts loads of other enemies because the sound level is so high.

riddle stone is not resurrecting the player when it is equipped.

enemies sometimes get stuck on corners.

enemies need to have a value- a value that decides which direction they should dodge. It should probably be an int.

rings need to have an effect assigned to them when worn instead of at the start of the game so that there could be two diamond rings, one that is weakness and cursed, and the other that is strength effect.

armor is way overpowered. the armorvalue needs to be reduced by a certain small amount with each hit from an enemy depending on the damage that enemy does. then the currentarmorvalue needs to be reassigned after each bit of damage to the armor. armor value should not be able to co below 0- if it would, the armor needs to show "broken" in its description.
