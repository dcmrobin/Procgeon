add up up down down left right left right b a start for a secret at the splash screen. and maybe a different secret, where you enter the same up up down down thing
but switch the b and a around, and you get a thing that has to do with a specific enemy.

need more armor, rings, and scrolls. ideas:
    1. a scroll that teleports you to random location
    2. ring of invisibility
    3. spiky armor that damages the attacker
    4. ring of aggravation- makes every enemy on the map come to your location
    5. ring of shadows- makes you harder to hit
    6. trenchcoat armor- does no protection
    7. ring that does nothing
    8. cursed ring that slowly drains health
    9. scroll that creates a decoy of yourself that enemies will chase
    10. ring mail armor
    11. scroll that sets hasMap to true
    12. suit of chaos- armor that randomly changes your armor value each frame
