add up up down down left right left right b a start for a secret at the splash screen. and maybe a different secret, where you enter the same up up down down thing
but switch the b and a around, and you get a thing that has to do with a specific enemy.

need more armor, rings, and scrolls.

convert all String to char arrays for memory stability.
