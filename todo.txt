Maybe for the boss fight, right at the end of the boss fight, the music
changes to a different tune as you're almost done.

For the boss fight, it could be that you have to find a bunch of shield generators or something in each room of the current dungeon, destroy them, and only then
could you hurt the boss- and you fail the boss fight if all the boss fight music ends.

There could be secret doors- walls you could walk through to another room that might be full of loot.

There could be an enemy type that has a randomly generated sprite.

As an easter egg, maybe in a very secret room, there would be a pool that has some cellular automata living in it that you can watch and randomize by going and pressing a
button on the wall next to it. The cellular automaton would be the Game of Life I think.

There could be a secret passage out of the map that transports you to another dungeon, but this time without any enemies and with weird items. Then it corrupts slowly after
time and keeps corrupting.

Add a sound level mechanic where depending on the sound effect played, the sound level integer will be increased, and that sound level integer is always added to every
enemy's detection radius. This will lead to enemies being able to detect the player from further away depending on how much noise is happening at the current time.

Have an extremely tanky enemy that does a ton of damage.

There could be enemies which look just like a random other enemy, but have one thing off about them and they are very strong.

Need a death screen for when killed by the boss.

What if you could lead a succubus through multiple levels and... befriend her? Idk, just a thought. Well, right now you need to make it so that if the succubusfollowscreen
has just been shown, the succubus is spawned right next to the player in a passive state. She could help fight enemies..?
