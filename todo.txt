add up up down down left right left right b a start for a secret at the splash screen. and maybe a different secret, where you enter the same up up down down thing
but switch the b and a around, and you get a thing that has to do with a specific enemy.

need more armor, rings, and scrolls. ideas:
    1. a scroll that teleports you to random location

add save/load feature. saves need to delete on death.

need explosion potion to make all tiles around player into ground tiles.
