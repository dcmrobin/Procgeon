As an easter egg, maybe in a very secret room, there would be a pool that has some cellular automata living in it that you can watch and randomize by going and pressing a
button on the wall next to it. The cellular automaton would be the Game of Life I think.

There could be a secret passage out of the map that transports you to another dungeon, but this time without any enemies and with weird items. Then it corrupts slowly after
time and keeps corrupting.

Add a sound level mechanic where depending on the sound effect played, the sound level integer will be increased, and that sound level integer is always added to every
enemy's detection radius. This will lead to enemies being able to detect the player from further away depending on how much noise is happening at the current time.

There could be enemies which look just like a random other enemy, but have one thing off about them and they are very strong.

Need a death screen for when killed by the boss.
