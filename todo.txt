add up up down down left right left right b a start for a secret at the splash screen. and maybe a different secret, where you enter the same up up down down thing
but switch the b and a around, and you get a thing that has to do with a specific enemy.

need more armor, rings, and scrolls. ideas:
    1. a scroll that teleports you to random location
    2. ring of invisibility
    3. spiky armor that damages the attacker
    4. ring of aggravation- makes every enemy chasing you never give up
    5.
    6. scroll of aggravation- makes every enemy on the map instantly target you
    7.
    8. cursed ring that slowly drains health
    9.
    10.
    11.
    12.
    13.
    14. scroll of create monster- creates a random monster near you
    15. scroll of destroy armor- armor value of currently worn armor is set to 0
    16. ring of clarity- grants immunity to blindness
    17. ring of freedom- makes player's speed not be able to go below base speed
    18. ring of maintain armor- makes your armor not be degraded by enemy attacks
    19. slow digestion ring- makes hunger decrease less
    20. ring of teleportation that randomly teleports the player around the map
    21. The One Ring- yep

what if the blank scroll actually had a massively powerful thing on it- you can only activate that if you drink a see all potion. come to think of it, what if
the see all potion basically upgraded scrolls?

special dialogue for different armors?
