sfx seem to be glitching when there's lots of enemies and the buttons are being pressed.

need splash screen- "VELHO"

sfx need to be kinda 3d so you can't hear a bullet impacting across the map.

armor is way overpowered. the armorvalue needs to be reduced by a certain small amount with each hit from an enemy depending on the damage that enemy does. then the currentarmorvalue needs to be reassigned after each bit of damage to the armor. armor value should not be able to co below 0- if it would, the armor needs to show "broken" in its description.
