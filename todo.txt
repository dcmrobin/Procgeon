Add a sound level mechanic where depending on the sound effect played, the sound level integer will be increased, and that sound level integer is always added to every
enemy's detection radius. This will lead to enemies being able to detect the player from further away depending on how much noise is happening at the current time.

There could be enemies which look just like a random other enemy, but have one thing off about them and they are very strong.
