add up up down down left right left right b a start for a secret at the splash screen. and maybe a different secret, where you enter the same up up down down thing
but switch the b and a around, and you get a thing that has to do with a specific enemy.

what if the blank scroll actually had a massively powerful thing on it- you can only activate that if you drink a see all potion. come to think of it, what if
the see all potion basically upgraded scrolls?
