This game is a Rougelike dungeon crawler for the Teensy 4.1 with a 128x128 SSD1327 display and eight buttons. The dungeons are procedurally generated, and so are other things in the game. The game has semi-real-time combat (time only moves when you shoot or move) and smooth movement, so happy times.
